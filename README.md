# TNS Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating core **Machine Learning algorithms** in Python.  
It covers **supervised learning** (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM), **unsupervised learning** (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering), and **dimensionality reduction** (PCA).  
Practical examples include Housing Price Prediction, Iris Dataset, MNIST Handwritten Digits, and Telecom Churn Prediction.
